# Parks in Washington - Project 2  Full-Stack CRUD Application
Parks in Washington is a web page where users can see information about National Parks located in the state. Using the National Parks API, it is possible to get information like the park name, description, code and images. It is possible to also add reviews to a specific park. Users can also use the search bar to look for a different park. Another feature is that parks can also be added to a list and see all parks. The user can also update the main image of the park, by simply clicking another one.
